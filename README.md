Portfolio Piece SDF11

Overview 
In this project, I created a Cach Bank Porfolio Piece, concentrating on using all of my learning experience throughout the course such as; HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. This entailed employing various CSS and Javascript techniques onto my HTML to attain a responsive and visually appealing design that functions effectively across diverse devices.

Reflections 

Areas of Mastery
With my experience with HTML and Javascript I was able to easily maneouver the entire project with little to no challenges.

Challenges
My challenges still remain to be using Tailwind CSS although I believe I am slowly getting the hang of it.

Areas for Improvement
Has to definitly be my Tailwind CSS, it was not a breeze but I could do better and "master" it.

Overall Learning Experience 
This project provided an invaluable hands-on experience in applying CSS layout techniques, solidifying my comprehension of CSS and its practical applications in web development, it cemented my Tailwind CSS use.
